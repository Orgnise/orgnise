## Orgnise
A Platform to create a single source of truth for all important information, such as use-cases, wikis, tech documentation, company information, policies, guidelines, announcements, and more.
<br/>

## Introduction
**Create**, **collaborate**, and **organize** all your work in one place. Organise is a knowledge base  management app where knowledge and collaboration meet. Dynamic pages give your team a place to create, capture, and **collaborate** on any project or idea.
Organise helps your team structure, organize, and share work, so every team member has visibility into institutional knowledge and **access to the information** they need to do their best work. 
With Orgnise, you can easily track the **progress** of your projects and tasks, ensuring that your team **stays organized** and on track.
