Pulse is a project management app built with React on the frontend and Node.js on the backend. With Pulse, you can easily track the progress of your projects and tasks, ensuring that your team stays organized and on track. 

Pulse's intuitive interface allows you to quickly add and update your projects and tasks, view their status and progress, and collaborate with your team members in real time.

Whether you're working on a small personal project or a large enterprise project, Pulse is the tools you need to stay on top of your work and achieve your goals.

## Project setup
- Install Node.js and npm on your local system. This is necessary to run the app's server-side code, which is written in Node.js. (Skip this if already setup on the system).
- Clone the "Pulse" app repository by running the following command in a terminal or command prompt window: `git clone https://github.com/TheAlphamerc/pulse.git`
- Install the app's dependencies by running the command: `npm install`
- Install server side code dependencies by running the two commands: `cd server` and `npm install`
- Start the app's server by running the command: `npm start`.
- In a separate terminal or command prompt window, navigate to the "pulse" root directory and start the app's frontend by running command: `npm start`
- The app will now be running on your local system. You can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

Note that these steps assume that you have already installed Node.js and npm on your local system and are familiar with using the terminal or command prompt to navigate directories and run commands.
